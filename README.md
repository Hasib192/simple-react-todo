# Simpel React ToDo App

This is a simple React project to learn React. With this project I have learn integrating JSX, props, useState hooks, map, filter, Bootstrap with React.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. <br>Then, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/Hasib192/simple-react-todo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd simple-react-todo
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the project in development mode, execute the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger hot-reloading, allowing you to see the updates in real-time.

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized production-ready build of your project, which can be deployed to a web server or a hosting platform.

## Acknowledgements
